# Counterfeit Object Oriented Programming (COOP)

### Abstract

The main idea behind COOP is counterfeiting â€“ that is crafting new objects in-memory from attacker-controlled payloads and to chain them together through virtual functions that are already present in the target application or in loaded libraries.
Each virtual function contained in a counterfeit object is called a vfgadget and is responsible for performing a small task. Similarly to ROP, vfgadgets can perform tasks like populating a value into a register. However when grouped together, multiple vfgadgets can execute more advanced operations, like API invokation.
